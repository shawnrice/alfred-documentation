Alfred Documentation
====================

This is a sort of temporary place to construct a wiki for Alfred 2, especially workflow development. Anyone can edit the wiki. The repository should be used to host screenshots and downloadable code. Don't include copies of libraries or workflows if they exist elsewhere; instead just link to them so that we don't have to worry about keeping them updated. If you want to push something to the repo, just put in a pull request.

And please, edit and add to the wiki.
